%global common_description %{expand:
Lumberjack is a Go package for writing logs to rolling files.

Lumberjack is intended to be one part of a logging infrastructure. It is not 
an all-in-one solution, but instead is a pluggable component at the bottom of 
the logging stack that simply controls the files to which logs are written.

Lumberjack plays well with any logging package that can write to an io.Writer, 
including the standard library's log package.

Lumberjack assumes that only one process is writing to the output files. Using 
the same lumberjack configuration from multiple processes on the same machine 
will result in improper behavior.}
